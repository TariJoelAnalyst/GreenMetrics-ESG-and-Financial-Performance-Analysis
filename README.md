## Project Overview
This report analyzes ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) and financial performance data from Greenmetrics Group across industries and regions. The goal is to uncover key patterns, and draw insights to guide strategic ESG-focused decisions.
Greenmetrics Group, is a fictional organization that specializes in tracking ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) metrics across various industries and regions. The company collects extensive data on revenue, profit margin, ESG scores, carbon emissions, energy consumption, and other sustainability indicators. This report analyzes that data using Microsoft Excel to uncover performance trends, analyze the relationship between ESG factors and financial outcomes, and provide insights that support strategic, sustainable decision-making.




## What is ESG

**Environmental (E)**: This looks at how a company affects the natural environment. It considers factors like carbon emissions, how efficiently energy is used, how waste is managed, and the overall use of natural resources.

**Social (S)**: This aspect examines how a company handles its relationships with people. It includes how the company treats employees, interacts with customers, supports diversity, and contributes to social responsibility in the communities where it operates.

**Governance (G)**: This area evaluates the company’s leadership and management practices. It focuses on the structure and accountability of the board, ethical behavior, transparency in operations, and adherence to laws and regulations.




## Problem Statement
Greenmetrics is facing a challenge in quantifying the relationship between ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) performance and financial success. Without clear insights, it becomes difficult to guide investment decisions, assess risk, or prioritize sustainability initiatives. This project aims to:
* Identify which ESG pillars (Environmental, Social, or Governance) most strongly correlate with financial growth or decline.
* Analyze how average ESG scores vary across companies experiencing positive, negative, or no growth.
* Uncover industry-specific or regional patterns in ESG performance and financial outcomes to inform data-driven decision-making.
* Examine the relationship between ESG performance and market capitalization over time.


## Data Overview

**Data Source**

The dataset used in this report was provided by The Data Immersed (TDI). It contains company-level information on ESG metrics and financial performance across various industries and regions. It contains 11,000 rows and 13 columns. The data within this table includes key metrics such as:

* Company ID: Unique identifier for each company
* Company Name: Name of the company
* Industry: Industry sector of the company
* Region: Geographical region where the company operates
* Year: Reporting year of the data
* Revenue: Total revenue generated by the company
* Profit Margin: Net profit as a percentage of revenue
* Market Cap: Market capitalization value
* Growth Rate: Company’s growth rate
* ESG Overall: Combined ESG score
* ESG Environmental: Score based on environmental practices
* ESG Social: Score based on social practices
* ESG Governance: Score based on governance practices
* Carbon Emissions: Amount of carbon emissions produced
* Water Usage: Amount of water consumed
* Energy Consumption: Total energy consumed by the company



## Data Transformation
**Step 1**: Data Cleaning in Power Query (Excel)
The dataset was first loaded into Power Query within Excel for initial cleaning. The following step was carried out:

* Data Type Conversion: Ensured that all fields had the appropriate data types. For example, Campaign ID was converted from text to number format for accurate numerical analysis.

**Step 2**: Handling Missing Values in Excel
Missing values were addressed using Excel functions:

* The COUNTBLANK function was used to identify columns with missing data. All columns were complete except the Growth Rate column, which had 1,000 blanks.

* These blanks were replaced with 0 to maintain data consistency and ensure accurate categorization in later steps.

**Step 3**: Column Creation in Excel
Additional columns were created in Excel to support meaningful analysis:

* Profit: Calculated by subtracting total costs from total revenue to determine each company’s actual profit.

* ESG Rating Category: Companies were grouped into High, Medium, or Low ESG categories based on their ESG Overall scores.

* Growth Status: Based on the Growth Rate values, companies were classified as having Positive or Negative growth.


##  Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

To better evaluate the performance of companies in the dataset, the following KPIs were used. These indicators help us measure both financial success and ESG alignment:

* Average Profit:
  This shows the average net profit earned by companies after expenses. On average, companies in the dataset achieved a profit of \$11 million, indicating moderate profitability across sectors and regions.

* Average Revenue:
  This measures the average amount companies earn from sales. The average revenue across the dataset is \$4.67 million, offering insights into business scale and operational capacity.

* Average Profit Margin:
  This metric tells us how efficiently companies are converting revenue into actual profit. An average profit margin of 11% means that, for every dollar earned, about 11 cents are kept as profit. This reflects healthy but not exceptional financial efficiency.

## Insights

### ESG Scores and Growth Performance 

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/af5bccee-3d02-4ee6-b300-b6ae2478588f)


- Companies with **Positive Growth** have the highest average ESG  score of **56**, suggesting a positive association between  ESG performance and financial growth.

- Companies with **Negative Growth** have a moderate average ESG score of **53**, which is only slightly lower than those with positive growth.

- Companies with **No Growth** show the lowest average ESG score at **52**.

Companies experiencing Negative Growth maintain a moderate ESG score, indicating that while strong ESG practices may support financial success, ESG performance alone does not guarantee positive growth. Other financial or operational factors likely influence company performance. This suggests the relationship between ESG scores and financial outcomes is complex and multifaceted, with ESG being an important but not exclusive factor in driving growth.



### Financial Performance And ESG Scores by Industry
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cf7ed729-3858-448b-9335-0bc1d72c384b)



- The **Finance** sector leads with the highest average ESG Overall score of **65**, alongside a strong average revenue of **$6.3K** and an average profit margin of **$14**.

- **Technology** companies also perform well, with a high average ESG score of **63**, the highest average revenue at **$15.8K**, and the highest profit margin of **$19**.

- **Healthcare** and **Retail** sectors show moderate ESG scores of **57** and **56** respectively, with Healthcare achieving a higher average profit margin (**$15**) compared to Retail (**$5**).

- Sectors such as **Consumer Goods** (ESG 55), **Manufacturing** (ESG 50), and **Utilities** (ESG 52) exhibit moderate ESG scores but lower revenues and profit margins compared to Finance and Technology.

- The **Energy** and **Transportation** sectors have the lowest average ESG scores (**49** and **46** respectively), despite Energy showing relatively higher revenue (**$8.8K**) but a moderate profit margin (**$11**), while Transportation records the lowest revenue (**$1.1K**) and profit margin (**$5**).

Industries with higher ESG scores—like Finance and Technology—tend to also have stronger revenue and profit margins, suggesting a positive link between ESG performance and financial success in those sectors. In contrast, industries like Energy and Transportation show that high revenue does not necessarily align with strong ESG scores or profit margins. This suggests the ESG-financial relationship is not uniform and may depend on the nature of the industry.



### Financial Performance And ESG Score by Region
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/91a3bdb6-bc83-451f-89c7-2d9e2b95bc84)


- **Europe** has the highest ESG score (**68**), showing strong sustainability efforts with steady revenue (**$5.6K**) and profit margin (**$10**).

- **Oceania** and **North America** also have high ESG scores (**62** and **61**) and stable profit margins (**$11**), though their revenues are slightly lower than Europe’s.

- **Latin America** and **Asia** fall in the middle range for ESG scores (**51–52**) but still maintain good profit margins (**$10–$11**). Interestingly, Latin America records the highest revenue (**$5.7K**).

- **Africa** and the **Middle East** have the lowest ESG scores (**45** and **43**) and also some of the lowest revenues (**$4.1K–$4.2K**), even though their profit margins (**$11**) are similar to other regions.

Regions with higher ESG scores, like Europe, Oceania, and North America, tend to show more balanced financial performance. Meanwhile, Africa and the Middle East lag behind in both ESG and revenue, which may point to a need for stronger sustainability efforts and business growth.





### Correlation Between Financial Metrics and ESG Pillars
**ESG and Financial Metrics Correlations Table**

The ESG and Financial Metrics Correlations Table was derived using Excel’s =CORREL function to measure the strength and direction of the relationship between each financial metric and the ESG pillars (Environmental, Social, and Governance). 

Among the three ESG dimensions, the **Environmental factor** shows the strongest positive correlation with all financial metrics—profit margin (**0.219**), revenue (**0.207**), and growth rate (**0.215**). This suggests that companies performing well environmentally tend to see better financial outcomes.

In contrast, the **Social** and **Governance** factors have much weaker or even slightly negative relationships with profit margin and growth rate, indicating they may not have as immediate a financial impact as environmental efforts.

Overall, this implies that businesses investing in environmental sustainability may be better positioned for stronger profitability and growth.




### Average Market Capitalization and ESG Performance Over the Years
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c0da5731-43c5-4614-95cb-8e49ca319d6d)


Between 2015 and 2025, there has been a steady upward trend in both **ESG scores** and **market capitalization**. ESG ratings rose from **51 in 2015 to 58 by 2025**, while the average market cap more than doubled from **$9.1K to $19.3K**.

This parallel growth suggests a possible link between improved ESG performance and increased market value, indicating that companies focusing more on environmental, social, and governance factors may also be experiencing greater investor confidence and financial growth over time.




## Recommendations
**Prioritize Environmental Improvements in Key Industries and Regions**
Industries such as Transportation and Manufacturing show notably low ESG scores, indicating significant room for improvement of environmental sustainable enviromental practises. Focus efforts on reducing carbon emissions, and enhancing energy efficiency. These measures will not only improve environmental impact but also drive operational efficiency and long-term profitability.

**Balance ESG Performance with Broader Business Growth Factors**
While investing in companies with strong ESG credentials is important, it is equally critical to evaluate other fundamental business drivers of growth. A well-rounded investment strategy considers both sustainability performance and financial health to ensure long-term value creation.

**Accelerate ESG Development in Underperforming Regions**
Regions like Africa and the Middle East lag in ESG performance. It is crucial to support these areas through capacity building, incentives, and collaboration with governments and NGOs. Encouraging adoption of ESG frameworks will unlock growth opportunities and foster sustainable development.

**Continuously Monitor Market Capitalization Trends to Optimize ESG Strategy**
Regularly tracking changes in market capitalization helps identify when companies experience accelerated growth. This insight enables timely adjustments to ESG strategies—reinforcing those that contribute positively to valuation and modifying or enhancing others to sustain or improve business performance.

**Reassess Social and Governance Efforts for Clearer Business Impact**
The social and governance pillars show weaker financial correlations and require ongoing evaluation. Focus on refining these efforts to deliver measurable outcomes that enhance stakeholder trust, regulatory compliance, and corporate reputation.


## Conclusion

This analysis highlights the importance of prioritizing strong ESG performance while also considering other key business drivers for balanced growth. Focusing ESG efforts on low-performing industries and regions, supporting innovation in leading sectors, and continuously monitoring market trends will help align sustainability with financial success. These insights provide a clear path for companies to enhance long-term value and stakeholder trust.
